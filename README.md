# veml6040
Library for RGBW color sensor on PSOC 5LP

## General stuff
This example program is written with PSOC Creator. The hardware used is:
- CY8CKIT-059 PSOC 5LP Prototyping Kit
- VEML6040: RGBW color sensor with I2C interface
- standard LCD

Warning: Be careful, when you program the PSOC. Always disconnect the PSOC from the sensor while programming. The sensor can only stand up to 3.6 V, so the 5 V from the USB connection could kill it.

## How to use

You can copy only the files **veml6040.h** and **veml6040.c** into your project to use the sensor. The I2C element in TopDesign is named **ICM**.
